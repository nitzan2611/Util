# Util
Java utilities that I found to be useful across projects:
* A graph data structure implementation
* Graph visualization (via Graphviz)
* Utility to summarize information in HTML
* Relation data structures: binary, ternary, with and without functional dependencies
* Utilities for manipulating collections and arrays
* String-manipulation utilities
* Files utilities
* Reflection utilities
* A generic pattern matching framework
* Pattern matching for Soot's Jimple language
* Utilities for StringTemplate, especially for automatically printing out a tree of objects
